# Wine_Classification
The wine data set consists of 13 different parameters of wine such as alcohol and ash content which was measured for 178 wine samples. These wines were grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars; therefore there are three different classes of wine. The goal here is to find a model that can predict the class of wine given the 13 measured parameters and find out the major differences among the three different classes. This is a classification problem and here I will describe four models and asses the accuracy of each model.
